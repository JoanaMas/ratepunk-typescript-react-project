# Ratepunk Typescript React Project by Joana Mastianica

## About The Project

This project was undertaken to apply for the Frontend Developer (ReactJS) position at the company Ratepunk. The main objective was to develop a single page landing desktop and mobile frontend application according to the company's send web page [design](https://xd.adobe.com/view/71b314b1-abe5-4705-8721-c8608a7eb26d-24e0/screen/4a89ddc1-a36c-4915-9a17-2fef477939f8).

Moreover, this project provided an excellent opportunity to gain proficiency in Typescript, learn new technologies that I never worked before with such as Next.js & JSONBIN.io, improve project structuring, develop reusable components, and implement them across various sections of the application. It was a great challenge to work with professional website design and try to create a pixel perfect website, exploring various tools for fonts and colors recognition. <br><br>

## Project requirements:

* Typescript
* React
* Next.js
* Sass modules
* JSONBIN.io to store & update data
